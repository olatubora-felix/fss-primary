                     <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;font: weight 300px;text-align:justify;color:#222;">
              The success story of the Federal Staff School, a Nursery/Primary school outfit, founded in 1982 encouraged the founding fathers - the committee of Heads of federal Government Establishment, to establish, National Staff Secondary School as it then was in the 1994/95 school year. it was founded on the strong belief, enunciated by the Committee, that education is thehiehest lagacy of an imperishable nature which a man can bequeath to his children. The idea is that such men are to be pitied who ammass material wealth and buld up assetss at theexpense of a sound education for their children. This category of children invariably turn around to soil the family's image or wreck the fortunes of the family.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;font: weight 300px;text-align:justify;color:#222;">
              The permanent site of the school was initially proposed for a site at Uwelu. However, the school had  to take off at a tempory site on the premises of Federal Staff School with an initial student population of 120. It was hoped that at the end of the first term the school would be in a position to move to the proposed Uwelu site.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;font: weight 300px;text-align:justify;color:#222;">
              However, the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) of the school which was inaugurated early in 1995 drew the attention of the Board of Governors to certain factors which the Association on felt might not make a huried movement to Uwelu advisable. The PTA then appealled to the Board of Governors to grant it the necessary permision to develop a building apposite the Federal Sataff School into class rooms to be used by the school pending the removal of those inhibiting factors which they highlighted.

            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;font: weight 300px;text-align:justify;color:#222;">
              Subsequently, the Board of Govenors of the School decided that the school should continue to function at Ugbowo
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;font: weight 300px;text-align:justify;color:#222;">
              The School took off with nine teachers including six University degree holders who assisted the Principal and a few non-academic staff in the pioneering work of the school. Today, there are 35 teaching staff and 10 non-teaching staff in the school. Evidently the school has since acqire a competitive edge over contempory schools across the country.
